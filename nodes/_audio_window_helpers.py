"""Pure window maths for Load Audio Pixaroma.

Kept separate from the node so the arithmetic can be tested with no ComfyUI and
no torch on the path (harness: D:\\Claude Tests\\_audio_window_test.py). Only
`apply_window` touches tensors, and it does nothing except act on the plan this
module produced.

The one subtlety worth knowing: "how many samples do we need" and "how many
samples exist" are DIFFERENT numbers, and every bug in this area comes from
conflating them. `plan_window` reports both, so the caller can never accidentally
return a short buffer while believing it matched.
